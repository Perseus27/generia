      The Shadow assumes a non-corporeal form, becoming significantly harder to detect and resistant to physical damage. 
      However, this comes with the drawback of vulnerability against magic.
      [br]All physical damage dealt while in [i]Shadow Form[/i] counts as [url:dmgtypes#Shadow]Shadow damage[/url].
      [br]While in [i]Shadow Form[/i], the Shadow can pass through any opening at least the size of a keyhole 
      as if it were difficult terrain.
    effect: >
      All Physical damage becomes Shadow
