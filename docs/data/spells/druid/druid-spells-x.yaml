      The Wildkeeper calls out to the soul of a beast kept inside an anchor. A spectral form of the beast materializes next to them, ready to fight at their side.
      [br][i]Only one beast can be summoned at a time. The beast must be no more than five levels higher than the Wildkeeper for the spell to work.[/i]
    effect: >
      The beast is controlled directly by the Wildkeeper, like any other summon. Its initiative is equal to that of the Wildkeeper.
