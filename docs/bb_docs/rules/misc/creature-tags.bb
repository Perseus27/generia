[h1]What are Creature Tags?[/h1]
Creature tags are passive features that are usually inherent to a species (or, more rarely, individuals). With very few exceptions (e.g., [i][url:#Colossus]Colossus[/url][/i]), they are attained at birth and cannot be gained or removed without drastic changes to the creature's fundamental nature.
