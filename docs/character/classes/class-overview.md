    <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
    <p>Classes are "ability packages" with drastically discounted SP costs.
    <br>A character may buy any number of classes, as long as the requirements (usually less specialized base classes) are fulfilled.</p>
    <p>When buying a class, all SP previously spent on components of that class are refunded. This refund is halved if the component in question was gained through the purchase of another class.</p>
    <h3>SP Costs</h3>
    <b>Tier I:</b> 20 SP
    <br><b>Tier II:</b> 30 SP
    <br><b>Tier III:</b> 50 SP
    <br><b>Tier IV:</b> 80 SP
