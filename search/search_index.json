It is advisable to give a character at least some civilian proficiencies, if only to encourage basic roleplay. Also, specific actions covered by civilian proficiencies may incur Disadvantage on a roll if the character attempting that action does not have that proficiency. Proficiency Value</p> <p>Since there are no types or traditions, characters invest directly into specific proficiencies. Again, the SP cost is equal to the target value. Raising a Proficiency Value from 0 to 1 costs 1 SP, raising it from 3 to 4 costs 4 SP,, and raising it from 0 to 4 in one go would cost 10 SP. Use Cases</p> <p>When making a roll of any type, the player may add one or more civilian proficiency values to the result, provided their reasoning is sound. If their proficiency is high enough, the DM might even choose to forgo the check entirely or turn it into a \"win more\" situation \u2013 success is guaranteed, but the player may roll for additional positive results. Example</p> <p>John Hunter is trying to set a trap in the deep wilderness to catch today's dinner. He has Hunting 4 and Survival 3, which would make a generic DC 10 check trivial. So, instead of making John roll for the small chance of not successfully trapping an animal, the DM decides to set another target (that he does not necessarily have to declare openly).

It is by far the most powerful religious organization on the continent, with significant influence in worldly and spiritual matters. It claims ownership over all Towers, though enforcing that claim is a different matter entirely. Special Features</p> Day and Night True Light <p>Spells of the Eternal Light are stronger when cast in the light of their respective deity, referred to as True Moonlight and True Sunlight. This is usually only the case underneath the open sky, but some spells and rituals can produce True Light as well. Effects</p> <p>Luna: If a healing Luna spell is cast in True Moonlight, one healing die may be rerolled once.Sol: If an offensive Sol spell is cast in True Sunlight, one damage die may be rerolled once. Sunstones and Moonstones</p> <p>Some Acolyte spells require additional materials in the form of magical stones that regularly fall from the sky. After use, they crumble into worthless dust. Temples grant an Acolyte three such stones (in any combination) per excursion. Extra stones can be acquired at personal expense. Light Explosion Effect</p> <p>Light damage dealt by Sol spells does not cause Blinded on explosions unless stated otherwise. Instead, it causes Lightburn. Foci</p> <p>Acolyte foci are usually blessed gold or silver amulets, though some prefer to use rings. In very rare cases, they channel their spells through relic weapons.

Their craft serves on the battlefield and at the healer\u2019s bench alike \u2013 turning rare reagents into munitions, tonics, salves, bombs, and even temporary constructs. Special Features</p> Transmutation <p>Spontaneous creations are called transmutations and come in three broad types. Permanent</p> <p>Permanent transmutations require ample preparation and execution time. The resulting item is durable and behaves like a regular piece of equipment. Volatile</p> <p>Fast, combat\u2011ready workings cast on the fly. Their effects fade quickly (after one Phase, unless specified otherwise) and the product crumbles to dust afterward. Construction</p> <p>Constructions are a subtype of permanent transmutations, mostly encompassing the creation of golems and similarly complex structures. Focus Gloves</p> <p>Alchemists use focus gloves inscribed with alchemical runes to safely channel volatile transmutations. The gloves\u2019 Armor Value (AV) equals the value of their mundane counterpart (e.g., cloth, leather). Alchemical Schools</p> Mechanics <p>The creation of devices and constructs: everything from firearms and ammunition to golems and specialized tools. Pharmacy</p> <p>The brewing of poisons, remedies, and diverse chemical compounds. </p> Basic Elements <p>The four basic elements Water, Stone, Fire, and Air are the core of alchemy. Cores and dust of those elements are relatively easy to obtain by drawing them from ambient mana or slaying elementals. Derivative Elements</p> <p>There are countless derivative elements, but only the following two are stable enough to use offensively:Ice: Water + StoneLightning: Fire + Air Aether</p> <p>Aether, known among wizards as \"the Arcane\", is understood by alchemists as the critical link between mass and elemental energy. Many devote themselves to its study, but few ever manage to grasp more than the very basics of its workings, since it seems to respond more to intent than any measurable factors.Most alchemists grudgingly accept it as the unknowable foundation of their craft and simply rely on it behaving in accordance with their wishes and experience. School Specialization (Proficiency Value)</p> Mechanics <p>Each point in Mechanics increases damage, DC, SA, and SD of all mechanical munitions and spells by 1. Additionally, the damage dealt by constructed golems is increased by 1. Pharmacy</p> <p>Each point in Pharmacy increases damage, DC, SA, and SD of all pharmaceutical munitions and spells by 1. Additionally, the DC of pharmaceutically caused status effects is increased by 1. </p> <p>Alchemists are adept at creating golems, mechanical constructs with a wide range of customization options. Golem Cores</p> <p>Golems require artificial \"cores\", small computing units the size of a marble that essentially serve as the construct's brain. The artificial spirits inhabiting these cores are soul-bound to their creator, meaning that they can only be used by the Alchemist who made them.Golem cores are universal, meaning that the same core could control a tiny or large golem. They can be reused as many times as the Alchemist pleases, as long as they are not destroyed. Core Damage</p> <p>Since cores are a golem's central processing unit, they occupy the Head hit zone, regardless of their actual location in the golem's body.Whenever a golem takes a core wound, it must succeed on a CON save against 10 + [Total Wounds], or it is considered inoperable (functionally Unconscious) until the damage is repaired. Core Destruction</p> <p>Repairing a completely destroyed core takes as long as creating a new one, provided there are no pieces missing. Core Generations</p> <p>Golem cores range from simple models to highly complex supercomputers. They are the defining factor of the resulting golem's overall strength, represented by their creature level:Core Mk. I: Level 10Core Mk. II: Level 20Core Mk. III: Level 30Etc.See: Golem Statblocks </p> <p>Golems come in four standardized sizes: Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large. Tiny</p> <p>Tiny golems are usually insect-like \u2013 diminutive and nimble. They are mostly useless in combat due to their inherent fragility and inability to equip Golem Kits, but they can serve as reliable scouting tools. Small</p> <p>Small golems tend to be bipedal humanoids around the height of a dwarf, but spindly limbs and lack of armor plating give them an unsettling appearance.Their role in combat is often that of an assassin, rapidly engaging soft targets from unexpected angles and then retreating to avoid destruction. Medium</p> <p>Medium golems are the most commonly used type, with a humanoid build, balanced attributes, and a variety of equipment options. In combat, they can serve as physical damage dealers, body guards, or highly durable distractions. Large</p> <p>Due to their immense ressource requirements, large golems aren't usually deployed in combat. Instead, their absurd strength and resilience are used for construction projects, logistics, and other manual labor.Despite this, they are slow, but terrifying combatants best suited for perimeter defense, deterrence, and breaching fortified enemy positions. Golem Control</p> Giving Orders <p>To give a golem new orders, an Alchemist must as a Free Action invest Concentration for the turn. This is only possible if the golem is within 20 meters of its creator.Once given orders, the Golem will continue to follow them until it is rendered inoperable through damage or lack of fuel. Order Complexity</p> <p>The intelligence of artificial spirits inhabiting Golem cores depends on the core's generation. Better cores can follow more complex and less specific instructions.Core Mk. I: TBICore Mk. II: TBICore Mk. III: TBIEtc. Golem Fuel</p> <p>Golems require elemental energy to run. This is represented by their EN value. They are not picky eaters; any element type will do. Refueling</p> <p>To refuel a golem, the Alchemist must insert elemental cores or similar sources of elemental energy into its refueling port. The amount of EN restored depends on the grade of the fuel:Dust: 1 ENCore, weak: 10 ENCore, normal: 20 ENCore, strong: 40 EN Idle Drain</p> <p>Active golems steadily lose energy each day. For a tiny golem, this drain is 1 EN each day, increasing by 1 for each size class above tiny. Golem Materials</p> <p>Golems can be made from either Stone or Metal. Stone is much easier to obtain in large quantities, while highly expensive metal golems offer the following benefits: Efficiency</p> <p>When refueling metal golems, they regain twice the EN. Resilience</p> <p>Metal golems have Resistance Sharp. </p> <p>Alchemist spells can create various ranged weapons. These weapons count as regular weapons, meaning they can be used in conjunction with combat skills and perks. Proficiency</p> <p>The Alchemist proficiency counts as weapon proficiency for transmuted weapons, including all bonuses this entails, e.g., an additional unmodified basic attack at Adept rank.The Alchemist's Mechanics value counts as weapon proficiency value. Attack Value</p> <p>The attack value formula of transmuted weapons is as follows:[Mechanics] + INT-MOD Damage</p> <p>The damage of transmuted weapons is entirely dependent on the used ammunition. They do not have base damage.</p>"},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/alchemist/what-is-an-alchemist/#Elements","title":"Elements","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/alchemist/what-is-an-alchemist/#Golems","title":"Golems","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/alchemist/what-is-an-alchemist/#GolemSizes","title":"Golem Sizes","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/alchemist/what-is-an-alchemist/#TransmutedWeapons","title":"Transmuted Weapons","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/alchemist/what-is-an-alchemist/#weapons-alchemist","title":"Transmuted Weapons","text":"NameTierSkillRangeSizeTags HandgunTier IKite-1/0/-1, 20m3x1ShortShotgunTier IIScattershot0/-1/-1, 16m6x2ShortGrenade LauncherTier II\u201324m (grenades only)6x3RifleTier IIIPierce-1/-1/0, 24m14x2Long"},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/bard/bard-spells/","title":"Bard Spells","text":"<p> Navigation Tier I <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier II <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier III <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier IV <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier X <li>Mostly Harmless (Charlatan)</li> <li>Eigth Rest (Troubadour)</li> See also: <li>What is a Bard?</li> <p></p>"},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/bard/bard-spells/#bard-spells","title":"Bard Spells","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/bard/bard-spells/#TierI","title":"Tier I","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/bard/bard-spells/#OffensiveI","title":"Offensive","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/bard/bard-spells/#verse-of-folly","title":"Verse of Folly","text":"TIER ICacophonyOffensiveAFFLICTIONVariet\u00e9Range: 20mSA WIL vs INTCost: 1 MPThe bard lashes a foe\u2019s soul with cutting tones.EFFECT:1d4 Absolute;

The specifics vary from circle to circle, but they all share a reverence for nature and the circle of life. Special Features</p> Vegetation <p>Druids\u2014especially those focused on Flora\u2014need access to different plant types for their magic. With the right seeds, they can grow many of these plants themselves. Restrictions</p> Range <p>A druid can only control plants within [WIL + Flora] \u00d7 2 meters. Lifespan</p> <p>Plants created via Wildgrowth that are no longer sustained by Concentration wither at the end of the druid\u2019s next turn; once concentration breaks, it can\u2019t be re-established for that effect. Magical Plants</p> <p>Druids cannot create magical plants with Wildgrowth. Plant Types</p> <p>Herb: Any non-woody plant (e.g., grasses, mosses, flowers, perennials).Shrub: Woody growth with several stem-like shoots and no single main trunk (e.g., bushes, hedges).Tree: A plant with a distinct woody main trunk; typically more massive than shrubs. Staff Spells</p> <p>Some druid spells can be cast as Staff Spells. This requires a wooden staff (or comparable item) as a \u201cplant substitute.\u201d Because a staff is dead wood, the druid must physically touch it while casting. Soul Anchor</p> <p>To summon a wild animal or assume its form, a druid needs a Soul Anchor: a ritually prepared trophy from an honorable hunt (commonly horns, claws, or teeth) that houses the animal\u2019s soul. If the animal form is slain, the anchor shatters and the soul returns irrevocably to the Eternal Wilderness. Keeping a soul trapped for too long is frowned upon; druids are strongly advised to release it no later than after one year. Regeneration</p> <p>Animal souls regain one wound per full hour of inactivity while stored in the anchor. Soul Bond</p> <p>A soul that undergoes the Soul Bond ritual no longer needs an anchor; it links to the druid\u2019s soul until either party dissolves the bond. If that form/summon is slain, it heals within the druid\u2019s astral body and can be called again once regeneration is complete. Foci</p> <p>Druid foci can be quite varied, though many use staffs made from gnarled branches of ancient trees (so-called 'Shillelaghs'). Most important for a Druid focus is that its base material was once \u2013 or still is \u2013 alive. Proficiency Values</p> Fauna <p>Each point in Fauna eases Concentration checks for Theriomorphosis by 1 and grants +1 WL to summoned animal souls. Flora</p> <p>Each point in Flora increases DC, PA, and SA of all Flora spells by 1.

<li>Sorcerer I</li> <li>Sorcerer II</li> <p></p> Sorcerers <p>Wizards rely on complex spell matrices, druids call on the intrinsic powers of nature, bardic magic follows poetic arts passed down over millennia, and the followers of the gods depend on their deities to reliably produce miracles.Sorcerers are different. Usually self-taught, they have nothing but their own senses and experiences to guide their casting. This lack of structure can \u2013 and often does \u2013 lead to unpredictable outcomes; some of them beneficial to the sorcerer, others not so much. Because of this, Sorcerers are usually not welcomed in guilds and organizations, and sometimes even outright hunted by temples and wizard towers. \u2026WARNING</p> <p>Sorcerers require a vast amount of game knowledge, improvisation, and healthy Player-GM communication, as well as sober acceptance of spontaneous character death.If even one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, playing a Sorcerer is NOT RECOMMENDED. Special Features</p> Chaotic Magic <p>Whenever a Sorcerer casts a spell, they must perform a Chaos Check. They may ease this check by both their Concept and Element proficiency values, or choose to fail it intentionally.GM Note: Keep in mind that a natural 1 always fails Chaos Checks. Concepts &amp; Elements</p> <p>Sorcery does not follow the strict rules of other spellcasting traditions. All sorceries are malleable to fit the Concept and Element the sorcerer is using. Concepts</p> <p>Concepts are the core of sorcerous spellcasting, defining the theme and flavor of a sorcerer's spells. A concept is usually a single word describing an object or idea, like \"Love\", \"Blade\", or even \"Cheesecake\". Generally speaking, a sorcerer's concepts should reflect a character's personality, heritage, or experiences, though exceptions may be made. Elements</p> <p>Elements contribute to the theme and flavor of a sorcerer's spells and define the damage type of offensive sorceries. They can be chosen freely from among the four primary elements (Water, Stone, Fire, Air) and the four secondary elements (Arcane, Ice, Light, Lightning).Note: Void is, in theory, a valid element, but in practice only recommended for NPCs or player characters who know exactly what theyre doing and have the full consent of their entire group to possibly being killed on sight by any random Templar crossing their path. 'Character Creation</p> <p>When first learning sorcery, a character must choose one concept and one element. When progressing to the next proficiency tier, the character may gain an additional concept, modify the original one, or gain an additional element. Flavoring</p> Examples Concept Flavor <p>The concept \"Blade\" might fit a flavor of dagger-shaped projectiles, bleed DoTs, and support spells to increase Sharp damage. In contrast, the concept \"Love\" might fit healing spells and power-of-friendship support \u2013 or, alternatively, seductive mind magic and energy-sapping debuffs. Element Flavor</p> <p>Very straightforward for offensive spells \u2013 a \"Blade / Ice\" sorcerer might throw icy daggers or cut enemies with sharp ice shards. Utility spells are a lot more open-ended, like granting allies bonus Ice damage on basic attacks or summoning a field of ice to impede hostile movement. Best Practices</p> Consistency <p>While creativity with sorceries is explicitly encouraged, characters should not stretch their concepts beyond disbelief. For example, claiming that a Healing / Water sorcerer should be able to incinerate enemies with a wall of flames \"because it looks like a wave, I guess\" will invariably lead to the GM annulling the attempt. Status Effects</p> <p>Pick up to three status effects per Concept/Element pairing and stick to them when it comes to spell and explosion effects. For example, Burning is an obvious pick for the Fire element, while Charmed fits the Love concept. Similarly, Bleeding and the Sharp damage dealt by the Water element go hand in hand, and Regeneration for the Healing concept makes a lot of sense.Spontaneous deviations are possible, but should still be congruent with concept and element. An ice-based spell should not cause Shocked. GM Discretion</p> <p>Like Freecasting, all attempts to work magic without clearly defined spells are subject to GM discretion. As usual, the  GM in question is strongly encouraged to accommodate the players' wishes to the highest degree possible, offering at least the possibility of success or a reasonable compromise for all but the most outlandish ideas. That said, anything too far out of the bounds of the party's current power level must be shut down decisively. Refer to the Freecasting rules for a rough estimation of acceptable spell effects. Character Examples</p> Compassion / Water <p>A healer with a soft heart. Regenerative support spells, cleanses, defensive crowd control, simple attack spells. Crown / Stone</p> <p>A domineering ruler. Powerful physical projectile spells, terrain manipulation, hard crowd control, zone control. Destruction / Fire</p> <p>A hot-headed menace. Powerful AoE spell attacks, burn DoTs, straightforward damage. Mask / Arcane</p> <p>A trickster. Disguises, displacement, backstabbing, confusion. Speed / Lightning</p> <p>A positioning expert. Great mobility, reliable spell attacks, MS support. Foci</p> <p>Sorcerers do not use foci. Some carry around keepsakes or other emotionally significant objects to help with spellcasting, though no measurable effect has been observed. Proficiency Values</p> Concept <p>Each point in a Concept increases DC, PA, SA, or SD of any relevant spell by 1. Element</p> <p>Each point in an Element increases the effects of relevant spells by 1, if reasonably applicable.</p>"},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/","title":"Tempering Spells","text":"<p> Navigation Tier I <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier II <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier III <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier IV <li>Offensive</li> <li>Defensive</li> <li>Utility</li> <li>Ritual</li> Tier X See also: <li>What is a Tempered?</li> <p></p>"},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/#tempering-spells","title":"Tempering Spells","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/#TierI","title":"Tier I","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/#OffensiveI","title":"Offensive","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/#impact","title":"Impact","text":"TIER IBodyOffensiveReactionMelee AttackCost: Strain 1, 1 MPThe Tempered puts all their considerable power into their next melee attack within this turn.EFFECT:On hit: Knockback [Body]."},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/#DefensiveI","title":"Defensive","text":""},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/tempering/tempering-spells/#bones-of-steel","title":"Bones of Steel","text":"TIER IBodyDefensiveDuration: 1 PhaseSURECASTCost: Strain 2, 1 MPThe Tempered's body becomes significantly denser and more resilient, but fast movement becomes more exhausting.

Even Shamans and Druids, whose traditions include a vast array of body enhancement or modification, do not break with this, as the mana has to take shape outside their physical form to accomplish its task.The Tempered, however, tread a different path. Their 'spells', if they can be called such, only act inside and upon their own bodies and souls. As a result, their magic is neither flashy like a Wizard's conjured fire nor unquestionably divine like an Acolyte's cleansing light. Its effects are by no means lesser, though \u2013 a middlingly powerful Tempered can swing an entire tree like others wield their swords.Such power does, of course, not come for cheap. Mana is a capricious resource at best, and keeping it confined to your own body requires not only an immensely strong will, but also a physique capable of withstanding its attempts to break free. Technique and delicacy, priceless for Wizards and Alchemists, are essentially worthless to the Tempered; they have to beat their magic into submission with sheer might. Special Features</p> Strain <p>Forcing mana through one's own blood vessels is utterly unnatural and not something living creatures are meant to do. As such, there is a strict limit on the amount of spells a Tempered can cast each Phase, called Strain.Every tempering spell causes a specified amount of Strain in addition to its mana cost. Once the accumulated Strain reaches the Tempered's [CON-MOD] (not including any buffs or enchantments), each further point of Strain causes one point of Exhaustion. Combo</p> <p>Tempering spells with the tag Combo may be cast within the same action as the skills or spells specified in the spell description. If the action types of the combined spells differ, the Tempered may choose either.MP and Strain costs are cumulative. Foci</p> <p>Tempered do not require foci. Proficiency Values</p> Body <p>Each point in Body increases the effect or DC of Body spells by 1. Soul</p> <p>Each point in Soul increases the effect or DC of Soul spells by 1. Expertise</p> <p>Tempering spells with the keyword Expertise can be cast at a higher tier once the Tempered reaches the corresponding expertise rank:Expertise 1 \u2013 BeginnerExpertise 2 \u2013 IntermediateExpertise 3 \u2013 Adeptetc.</p>"},{"location":"character/spellcasting-traditions/wizard/what-is-a-wizard/","title":"What is a Wizard?","text":"<p> Navigation See also: <li>Wizard Spells</li> Related Classes <li>Wizard</li> <li>Hermetician</li> <li>Kinetician</li> <li>Meteorician</li> <li>Thermician</li> <li>Magister</li> <li>Magus</li> <p></p> Wizards <p>Wizards rely solely on their own meticulously earned skill to cast their magic, resulting in expensive, but highly destructive abilities. Special Features</p> Magic Schools <p>Unlike other spellcasters, wizard spells are separated into element-based magic schools. Their proficiencies are separated, meaning that a wizard skilled in one school cannot cast spells from another school unless he buys the appropriate proficiency. Hermetics</p> <p>Elements: Arcane, Light Kinetics</p> <p>Elements: Stone, Water Meteorics</p> <p>Elements: Air, Lightning Thermics</p> <p>Elements: Fire, Ice Multi-School Spells</p> <p>Some wizard spells incorporate elements from different schools (e.g., Air from Meteorics and Fire from Thermics). In those cases, it is enough to reach the required proficiency tier in one school, though it is required to be at least a Beginner in the other. Matrix Crystals</p> <p>Some wizard spells require Matrix Crystals, specially crafted gems that help with constructing complex spell matrices. One such crystal can also act as a substitute for Concentration for the duration of one Phase, provided the spell did not require a matrix crystal to cast it in the first place. Crystals are single-use and crumble to worthless dust after they burn out. Foci</p> <p>Wizards traditionally use staffs and wands as foci. They are adorned with crystals containing generic spell matrices for quick and easy casting. Element Specialization (Proficiency Value)</p> <p>Wizards may specialize in individual elements (e.g., Fire) by buying element skill levels with SP, functionally acting as Proficiency Value.Each point in a specific element has the following effects for spells of that element:</p> <ul><li>DC, PA, or SA is increased by 1</li><li>Damage dealt is increased by 1. For AoE spells, this bonus is halved.</li></ul> Spell Upgrades <p>Wizard spells with roman numerals in their name (Mana Bolt I, Arcane Barrier I) can be upgraded for 4 SP to the equivalent of the next spell tier.
